# HOSS - Hamilton Open Source Software
This repository is not associated with an organization and has no personal agenda other than to highlight the great open source work originating out of or being done in **Hamilton Ontario Canada** and our surrounding communities. Github was chosen as the medium simply to reflect the spirit and nature of the work that will be listed here. The intention is to keep this list fluid and allow collaboration to keep the list updated.
